        <h1>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>SECTION ONE</h2>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.</p>
            <p>CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.</p>
            <p>After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of the CSS specification and individual modules progress. CSS modules now have version numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color Module Level 5.</p>

             <h2>Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</h2>
            <p>Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how it works:</p>

            <img src="css-declaration-small.png" alt="CSS p declaration color red in code">
            <caption> CSS p declaration color red</caption>
            <p>The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.) Note the names of the individual parts:</p>

            <h3>Selector</h3>
            <p>This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, <p> elements). To style a different element, change the selector.</p>

            <h3>Declaration</h3>
            <p>This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.</p>

            <h3>Properties</h3>
            <p>These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the <p> elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.</p>

            <h3>Property value</h3>
            <p>To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)</p>

            <h3>Note the other important parts of the syntax:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})</li>
                <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
                <li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <p>To modify multiple property values in one ruleset, write them separated by semicolons, like this:</p>

<code>
    p {
    color: red;
    width: 500px;
    border: 1px solid black;
    }
</code>
